_TL;DR_

Publish a blog post with ` git push `

![](http://i.imgur.com/JKMdO42.gif)

My motivation to build this blog engine was based on 3 factors.
- Write on any device ( i.e Mobile, Laptop) using CLI or text editor
- Never worry about database backups and keep track of all changes I made on an article
- Make publishing simple without touching the server

This project uses git to track all changes made on an article, as all the writing is done in markdown format, I can write posts on multiple devices ( CLI (Termux) on Android, VIM or Sublime on Arch ) switching back and forth. Finally I can publish those writings by adding metadata to the metadata.json file. In other words the posts are visible on blog only when they are enabled in `metadata.json`.
